# 🌀 DaSiWa WAN 2.2 Master: Merger & Quantizer (WIP)

DaSiWa WAN 2.2 Master is a high-performance industrial toolkit designed for quantizing Wan 2.2 (14B) Video Models. Specifically engineered for systems with 64GB RAM and NVIDIA Ada (40-series) or Blackwell (50-series) GPUs.

📦 GGUF MoE Specialist: Native Wan 2.2 GGUF quantization with Self-Healing 5D Expert Injection to preserve video tensor shapes and prevent "gray-screen" outputs.

💎 Next-Gen FP Quants: Native support for NVFP4 (Blackwell) and FP8 E4M3 (Ada) via optimized convert_to_quant integration.

🛡️ 64GB Safety Logic: Intelligent memory flushing and subprocess monitoring to prevent OOM (Out of Memory) crashes during 14B model handling.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have uv installed for high-speed dependency management:
Bash
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
``` 

### Installation & Launch

The included start.sh environment syncing, and build requirements automatically.
Bash
```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

#### 🛠️ Quantization Guide

|Format|Target|Hardware|
|-----:|-----:|-------:|
| GGUF (Q2-Q8) | Universal / CPU | Best for VRAM-constrained systems (8GB - 12GB).|
| FP8 (E4M3) | RTX 40-Series | Native Ada acceleration; best quality/speed balance.|
| NVFP4 | RTX 50-Series | Blackwell native 4-bit; extreme VRAM savings for 14B models.|
| MXFP8 | RTX 50-Series | Microscaled 8-bit; near-lossless video quality.|
